[Linear Regression Example](https://github.com/iamjaswanth/Linear-Regression-Example)

A Simple Linear Regression Example to Predict Canada Per Capita Income

#
[Multivariate Linear Regression](https://github.com/iamjaswanth/multivariate-linear-regression)

written python code to predict salary using multivariate linear regression in python (using sklearn linear_model). Salaries are dependent on 3 independent variables: experience, test score and interview score. Pandas dataframe is used to fill missing values first and converted string number to Integer number using w2n then used that dataset to train a multivariate regression model.
